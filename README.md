# Dry-Fruit-Offline-Billing-System
This is just an offline billing system made using python, tkinter module and mysql.

People can buy any item and their data gets stored in the mysql database.
The Owner of the store can actually open the admin section and add/delete/update/view the stock details. And the entry to the admin page is password protected(so it is much more secure).
The interface of this application is very user friendly because it is GUI (Graphical User Interface) made using tkinter module.
There is a history of purchases stored in the database.

All this is possible because of mysql.

Here is a short brief view of my project.

- When the program starts, he can either choose admin or customer
